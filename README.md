# Fit Friend

This app was built to help users keep track of their current physical stats and goals. 
This app also implements a sign up through Facebook which allows users to set up a quick profile. 

The main goal of this app was to give the user the privacy option of being able to put their physical stats and goals on an app but allow the user a sense of privacy by giving only accepted friends the ability to view their profile.

Users can log their workout info as well and so that they can be more imformative about the next time they workout and know how many reps or sets to aim for, as well as figure out what weight to use.

#Future Features

Adding an exercise database that is catagorized by bodyparts. Each exercise will give a description of that exercise and provide an example video of how to do that particular exercise.

Adding a meal-plan feature so that users can track their overall calories and know how to tweak their diet to achieve their goals.
